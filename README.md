Stack:

A stack is a data structure based on the principle Last In First Out. stack is container to hold nodes and has two operations — push and pop. The push operation is to add nodes into the stack and pop operation is to delete nodes from the stack and returns the top most node.


pop — Pulls (removes) the element out of the stack. The location is specified by the pointer

push — Pushes (inserts) the element in the stack. The location is specified by the pointer.

peek — returns the item on the top of the stack, without removing it.

empty — returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise

swap — the two top most elements of the stack can be swapped
